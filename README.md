# Numbers
Number provider e.g. to learn a foreign language. It provides random numbers, I use to practice translation.

# How to use it?
It's a node command line tool.
## Commands
```
node index.js
```

# Why I wrote it?
I'm new to node.js. 
So it's more a little excercise to get some practice than a serious project.
