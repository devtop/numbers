# Numbers
Number provider e.g. to learn a foreign language.
It provides random numbers, I use to practice translation.

# How to use it?
It's a node command line tool.
Once you've started it, you'll be asked for input.
Afterwards you can step through the numbers and practice your language.
## Commands
```
node index.js
```

# Test
The project is mostly written in TDD.
Hopefully that increases the code quality.
Tests without continuous integration tends to degrade.
So, Codeship is monitoring and integrating the project.

# Roadmap
* arithmetic problems
* dates
* phone numbers
* number to written speech
* statistics of your exercises
* status bar

## upcoming steps
* motivation module ;)
* seperation of program flow
* introduce sinon
* more tests

# Why I wrote it?
I'm new to node.js.
So it's more a little excercise to get some practice than a serious project.
