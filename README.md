# Numbers
Number provider e.g. to learn a foreign language.
It provides random numbers, I use to practice translation.

# How to use it?
It's a node command line tool.
Once you've started it, you'll be asked for input.
Afterwards you can step through the numbers and practice your language.
## Commands
```
node index.js
```

# Roadmap
* arithmetic problems
* dates
* number to written speech
* statistics of your excercises
* statusbar

# Why I wrote it?
I'm new to node.js.
So it's more a little excercise to get some practice than a serious project.
